The schema-first approach allows you to create idiomatic GraphQL types, mutations, and queries
in a manner familiar to GraphQL developers.
The schema is deployed and can be updated by deploying a new schema without
recreating the tables and columns directly.
Under the covers, this approach will create and modify the CQL tables to match
the GraphQL types.
The schema can be modified for CQL decorated schema, such as specifying table
and column names in Cassandra,
while retaining GraphQL-centric names for the types that correspond.
If you are a GraphQL developer, this approach is for you.
