== Naming conventions for GraphQL

The GraphQL API uses specific naming conventions to preserve capitalization and
special characters. Note that if typical GraphQL naming conventions are used,
such as `camelCase`, that the underlying Cassandra storage tables will use double
quoting to preserve the capitalization. If a naming conflict occurs, an error
results that the table already exists.
