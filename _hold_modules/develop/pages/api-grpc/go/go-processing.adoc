== Go processing result set

After executing a query, a response returns rows that match the SELECT statement.
You can call `getResultSet()` on the response to grab a `ResultSet` to process. 
Note the function may return `undefined` if no `ResultSet` is returned; check if it is defined or cast.

Since the result type is known, the `ToString` function transforms the value into a native string.
Additional functions also exist for other types such as `int`, `map`, and `blob`.
