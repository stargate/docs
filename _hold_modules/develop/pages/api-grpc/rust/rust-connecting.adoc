== Rust connecting

=== Authentication

This example assumes that you're running Stargate locally with the default credentials
of `cassandra/cassandra`.
For more information regarding authentication please see the
xref:secure:authnz.adoc[Stargate authentication and authorization docs].

You'll need to generate a token to insert into the client connection code:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$bash/get-table-based-token.sh[]
----

=== Set up client

The main structure that provides the interface to Stargate is `StargateClient`.
The simplest way to obtain an instance is to use the provided `builder`:

[source, rust]
----
include::example$rust/rust-connecting-withAuth.rs[]
