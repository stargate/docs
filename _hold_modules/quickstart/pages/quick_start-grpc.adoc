= Stargate gRPC API QuickStart

*Time to complete: 5 minutes*

// LLP - REWRITE FOR GRPC
// INCLUDE EXAMPLES WITH BLOOMRPC

Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a database.
In this QuickStart, you'll be up and running on your local machine with the
gRPC API plugin that exposes ???

== Prerequisites

== Creating schema

In order to use the GraphQL API, you must create schema that defines the keyspace and
tables that will store the data. A keyspace is a container for which a
`replication factor` defines the number of data replicas the database will store.
Tables consist of columns that have a defined data type. Multiple tables are contained
in a keyspace, but a table cannot be contained in multiple keyspaces.

// create collection
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=CreateTable]

// check NS and collections exist
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=CheckKS]

== Interacting with tables

// API generation

// write document data

// read document data
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=ReadData]

// update document data
include::develop:page$dev-with-graphql-cql-first.adoc[tag=UpdateData]

// delete document data
