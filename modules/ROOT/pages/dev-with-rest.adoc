. Follow the steps in the prerequisites to get your xref:manage:org/managing-org.adoc#_manage_application_tokens[application token] and set up your environment variables.
. In your command-line interface associated with your environment, paste the following environment variables copied for your {astra_db} database:

[source, shell]
----
export ASTRA_DB_ID=<database_id>
export ASTRA_DB_REGION=<database_region>

// == Using Postman

// If you prefer, you can use Postman as a client interface for exploring REST APIs
// (https://www.postman.com/downloads/[download here]).
// We've provided a
// https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stargate/docs/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/json/Stargate_REST_API_users_keyspace_Astra.postman_collection.json[Stargate REST API Postman Collection]
// that you can import in Postman to play with the examples shown in this walkthrough.

// Now you're ready to use the REST API for CRUD operations.
