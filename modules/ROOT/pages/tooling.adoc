== Postman resources

Postman is a widely-used collaboration platform for API development and testing.
Using this third-party tool, you can easily test APIs with environments generated
for your test platforms and imported testing collections of API queries.

Postman collections are comprised of REST, Document, or GraphQL schema and queries
to run or test against one or more defined environments.
The tool includes a link:https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/[collection runner testing utility]
for testing against query assertions embedded in the collection.
Collections and environments can be link:https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/[imported or exported]
with Postman.

For Stargate development, three collections that correspond to the documentation code examples are available:

* link:https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/json/Stargate-OSS-Astra-REST-API-users_keyspace.postman_collection.json[REST collection]
* link:https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/json/Stargate-OSS-Astra-Document-API-myworld.postman_collection.json[Document collection]
* link:https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/json/Stargate-OSS-Astra-GraphQL-API-library.postman_collection.json[GraphQL collection]

Each collection lets you try out creation, insertion, and deletion of both data and schema, as required.

To use the collections, you'll need to download and configure a postman environment.
Two environments are also available, one for the open-source Stargate docker image and one for https://astra.datastax.com[DataStax Astra].
A small amount of configuration is necessary in the single environment to set your
parameters before use.
