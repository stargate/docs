= Workflow overview

This workflow is for frequent contributors and Stargate Docs team members who
make major changes, add documents, examples, and images, and plan to work on the
same set of changes over several days before requesting sign-off.

== Workflow steps

These steps, described under Setting Up Your Workspace, only need to be done
once or the first time you plan to contribute to a repository:
