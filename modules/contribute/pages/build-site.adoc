= Build the documentation site locally
:experimental:

== Run Antora using npm

We have `npm` run commands that can build the docs locally using the `site-local.yaml` file. Use this command to build the HTML rendering of the docs, so you
can check them with a browser.

. Open a terminal and switch into the _docs_ folder.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ cd path/to/docs
----

. Run Antora using `npm` :
+
[source, shell]
----
$ npm run build:local
----
+
The site generation is complete when the command prompt (`$`) reappears in the terminal.

. Antora generates the site into a directory named _build/site_.
Switch to it.
+
[source, shell]
----
$ cd build/site
----
+
You'll be able to see the structure of the built documentation. 

. Use a browser and `Open file` and find the page that you wish to check.
