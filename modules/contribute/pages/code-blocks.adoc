== Code Blocks

Source code examples are entered into AsciiDoc listing blocks.
Listing block content is displayed exactly as entered, and any indents and endlines are preserved.
If the `source` style and a language are assigned to the block, the code is syntax highlighted on the site.

[source,asciidoc]
.Delimited code block with title
....
include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=dl-co]
....

Rendered as:

include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=dl-co]

Commands executed in a CLI are assigned the language `console` and lines are preceded by the command prompt (`$`).

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=console]
....

Rendered as:

include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=console]

// LLP: 12.14.21 commented out for now. We don't have copy yet.
//Note, using `[source,console]` ensures that the `$` prompt is not copied when the user clicks the clipboard icon that appears upon mouseover above the code block.

Short code snippets don't need delimiters as long as they don't contain blank lines or callouts.

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=single]
....

Rendered as:

include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=single]

Code blocks can be grouped in a parent block element.

[source,asciidoc]
....
include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=group-code-blocks]
....

Rendered as:

include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=group-code-blocks]

[#callouts]
== Callout numbers

Callouts add annotations to lines in code blocks.
The first callout number must be placed after the final character on a code line.
The responding callout is listed below the block and followed by the annotation text.
Multiple callout numbers can be used on a single line.

[source,asciidoc,subs=-callouts]
....
include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=callouts]
....

Rendered as:

include::example$code-blocks.adoc[tag=callouts]

TIP: To make callouts copy-and-paste friendly, put them behind the line comment syntax of the code snippet's language.
For example, callouts in a YAML example are placed behind the hash symbol (`#`).

The callout list does not have to follow immediately after the code block containing the callouts.
For example, you can include an introductory sentence or paragraph between the code block and the callout list.

Instead of marking up each callout with its own number, such as `<1>`, `<2>`, `<3>`, you can use `<.>` for each callout.
When you use this method, the callouts are numbered automatically.

[#include-code]
== Inserting Examples with the Include Directive

The include directive inserts an entire file or tagged region from a file stored in the _examples_ directory of a module into a code block.
Just specify the xref:includes.adoc[resource ID of the example file in the directive].

[source,asciidoc]
....
.Query result
[source,json]
----
\include::example$contact.json[]
----
....

You will find most of the code samples included in `$examples` directories alongside the `pages` parent to the `.adoc` file that is calling them. 
Using `include::` adds a _Git hub_ link on mouseover, which leads to the code file on the repo.

For a tagged region of a source file, set the tags around the code sample using the comment character appropriate to the source language, such as `//` or `#`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[source,javascript]
----
# tag::setup[]
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require("apollo-server");
const { buildFederatedSchema } = require("@apollo/federation");

const port = 4001;
# end::setup[]

# tag::schema[]
const typeDefs = gql`

  # need to declare types used by cql
  scalar Uuid
  scalar Date

  type Order @key(fields: "checkout_id reader books") {
    checkout_id: Int!
    reader: Reader
    books: [Book]
----
....

And add the appropriate `[tag=]` to the `include::`.

[source,asciidoc]
....
.Get just the setup
[source,javascript]
----
\include::example$graphql/1orders.js[tag=setup]
----
....

Note that we aim to keep all code files in the examples directory runnable -- or at least compilable -- so if you are adding a snippet of code to an existing file, please test it.
