= Create a working branch

Always make a new working branch for your work, no matter how small the change.
You can create a working branch in Atom or from the command line.

[#base-branch]
== Choose the right base branch

A base branch contains the original source documentation.
You create working branches from a base branch and send pull requests to a base branch for integration.
A working branch isolates changes that solve a single issue.
A pull request submitted from a working branch that only contains closely related changes is easier to test, review, and merge.

// LLP 12.13.21 CHANGE TO MAIN
The Stargate documentation https://github.com/stargate/docs[repositories] maintain one base branch: main.

At the current time, we only maintain a single version of the Stargate docs.

The name of a working branch should pair it with the issue it resolves.
For example, if you're resolving `stargate/docs` issue #6500, you could name the working branch `sgdocs-6500`.

Now you're ready to <<next-steps,write or edit documentation>>.

[#work-branch-cli]
== Create a Working Branch from the Command Line

 $ cd path/to/repository-folder

. <<base-branch,Choose the right branch>> to base your changes on and check it out.

 $ git checkout name-of-base-branch

. Download the latest changes from the upstream repository.

 $ git pull upstream name-of-base-branch

. Create a working branch from the base branch and checkout the working branch.
