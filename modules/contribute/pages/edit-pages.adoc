= Edit existing documentation

The following sections describe the document editing process using the Atom editor; however, you can write AsciiDoc in the plain text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

== General editing steps using Atom

. Make sure you've added the repository directory to the *Project* panel, xref:create-branches.adoc[created a working branch], and switched to it.
The name of your working branch is displayed next to the image:git-branch.svg[,16,role=icon] branch icon at the bottom of the editor.
. In the project panel, expand the repository to view its folders and files.
Locate the page, partial, or example file you want to edit and double click on it to open it in an editor pane.
.. If you're not familiar with the structure of a documentation component, see xref:repositories.adoc#dir-structure[Directory Structure and Key Files].
. Edit the content.
The <<edit-server,next section>> steps through an editing scenario.
.. For AsciiDoc tips and help, see xref:basics.adoc[AsciiDoc Basics].
. If you installed the xref:install-git-and-editor.adoc#adoc-packages[AsciiDoc Preview package], go to menu:Packages[AsciiDoc Preview > Toggle Preview].
A basic preview of the rendered document is displayed in an adjacent pane.
. Press kbd:[Ctrl,S] to save the file.

When your edits are complete, you're ready to xref:build-site.adoc[build the site locally] on your device and check changes.

== Editing a page in stargate/docs

Let's step through editing a stargate/docs component page using Atom.
The syntax changes described in this section represent some of the improvements you can make.

=== 1. Open the file

In the project panel, in the image:repo.svg[,16,role=icon] docs repository, go to menu:modules[developers-guide > pages].
Double click on _graphql-first-using.adoc_ to open the AsciiDoc file in the editor pane.

=== 2. Set and reference an attribute

The Docs team wants to use some text in the page's HTML description meta-tag.
Set the `description` attribute in the xref:pages.adoc#doc-title[header of the document].

[source,asciidoc]
----
the Stargate GraphQL API (Schema-first)
:description: Describes the graphQL schema-first method of using the Stargate GraphQL API.
----

If the description is a paragraph, enter a space after the end of the first sentence, then a `\` so the heaader is not broken.
Descriptions can use xref:pages.adoc#ventilate[ventilated prose (aka sentence per line)], just as the rest of the documentation does.

[source,asciidoc]
----
the Stargate GraphQL API (Schema-first)
:description: Describes the graphQL schema-first method of using the Stargate GraphQL API. \
If you need to add another sentence to the description, use the `\`.
----

=== 5. Preview and save the file

If you installed the  xref:install-git-and-editor.adoc#adoc-packages[AsciiDoc Preview package], go to menu:Packages[AsciiDoc Preview > Toggle Preview].
A basic preview of the rendered document is displayed in an adjacent pane.

Press kbd:[Ctrl,S] to save the file.
In the project panel, the file name will change color, indicating it's unstaged.

Before submitting your pull request for the changes, you need to xref:build-site.adoc[build the site locally] to check your changes on your device.
