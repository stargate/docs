= Attributes and roles

== Setting and referencing document attributes

AsciiDoc attributes are optional key-value pairs that can be used to hold names, URLs, and reusable content phrases.
Some attributes are built-in to link:https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]; others are defined especially for the Stargate documentation.

When defined in the document header, these attributes become available to the page and all of its includes.
Each attribute must be entered on a separate line, known as an attribute entry.
The syntax of an attribute entry as follows:

 :name: value

In this case, `name` is the name of the attribute and `value` is the optional value.
You can see several examples of attribute entries in the listing below.

.Examples of document attributes

[source,asciidoc]
....
= Page Title
:page-topic-type: concept <1>
:source-language: javascript <2>
:url-sgtooling: https://stargate.io/docs/stargate/1.0/tooling.html <3>
:tabs: <4>

<1> Attribute names that start with `page-` are specially handled by Antora.
<2> A value can be assigned to a built-in attribute in the document header.
<3> Writers can set and define their own attributes.
<4> Some attributes are assigned an implicit value.
In this case, the tabs feature is turned on by setting `tabs`.
<5> Reference an attribute in the body of the document by entering the attribute name inside a set of curly brackets (`+{attribute-name}+`).
<6> Code blocks are assigned the source language `javascript`.

== Unsetting a document attribute

Some built-in attributes are set (turned on) by default and set for all of the Stargate document in the playbook.

For example, section IDs are automatically generated for all of the Stargate documentation pages.
This occurs because the `sectids` attribute is turned on by default.
To unset (turn off) an attribute on a page, prefix the name with a bang (`!`).

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
:!sectids: <1>
----
<1> Unset `sectids` with a `!` so that sections IDs are not generated from the section titles in the document.

See the `site-local.yaml` and `site-publish.yaml` Antora playbooks in the link:https://github.com/stargate/docs[Stargate docs repo] to review which
AsciiDoc attributes are currently set and unset for all of the Stargate documentation pages.

// LLP 10.08.21 Need to decide on custom roles and whether they are needed
== Using roles

A role applies alternative or additional CSS styles to a document, block, or phrase.
The styles for each role are defined by the UI.
A role is applied to a block or phrase by prefixing the role name with a dot and
inserting it between a set of square brackets (`[.role-name]`).

=== Page role

Assign a role to the page works a little differently.
When set, the `page-role` attribute applies one or more roles to the entire page.
`page-role` is an example of a <<Using Page Attributes,page attribute>>.
It must be defined in the document header.

Unlike with blocks and phrases, page roles are not prefixed with a dot and must
be separated by a single space (following the same rules as CSS classes).

The Stargate documentation currently supports two page roles:

* tiles
* -toc

These roles are often combined, as you can see in this example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
:page-role: tiles -toc

Page contents.
----

You can see the `tiles -toc` page role combination in action on the xref:server:getting-started:starter-kits.adoc[Starter Kits page].
The tiles role arranges the secondary section titles as tiles (in two columns).
The -toc role tells the UI template not to add a table of contents (TOC) to the page.

== Using page attributes

Certain document attributes are reserved specifically for use with Antora.
These are known as page attributes.
All page attributes begin with the `page-` prefix.
The prefix is removed and the remainder is passed on to the UI as metadata.
For the most part, it's up to the UI to decide how to use this information.

There are several built-in page attribute in Antora and a few others that the
Stargate UI already recognized.

=== Built-in page attributes

The built-in page attributes in Antora are as follows:

page-layout:: Specifies the UI layout to apply to the page.
If not set, the page layout defaults to `default` (hence loading the `default.hbs` template).
+
The home page for the site uses the `home` layout by assigning `:page-layout: home` in the document header.

page-partial:: Indicates that this page may be included in another page.
Only requires for AsciiDoc files in the pages directory (not the partials directory).

page-aliases:: A comma-separated list of alternate page IDs that should redirect to this page.
When you move a page, you might want to list the old page ID in this attribute so that the web server will redirect visitors from the old page to the new location.

Antora also assigns several page attributes on each page to provide information about which component, version, and module in which the page is located.
You can find a list of these attributes in the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-and-site-attributes/[Antora documentation^].

// LLP 10.08.21 Need to decide on custom page attributes and whether they are needed
=== Custom Page Attributes

Custom page attributes are used to pass information from the document to the UI.
It's up to the UI to give these attributes meaning.

The Stargate UI supports the following custom page attributes:

page-edition:: Used to add a blue badge under the page title that indicates the server edition to which the content applies.
The badge automatically links to \https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions.
The value of the attribute is used as the text of the badge.

page-status:: Used to add an orange badge under the page title that indicates the status of the page, such as beta or the minimum software version to which the content applies.
The value of the attribute is used as the text of the badge.

description:: Sets the value of the meta description in the HTML head.
Note that the `page-` prefix is not required in this case.

keywords:: Sets the value of the meta keywords in the HTML head.
Note that the `page-` prefix is not required in this case.

Additional custom page attributes can be added by agreeing on a contract between the page and the UI.
