The Stargate documentation repository uses a standard directory structure and nomenclature.
Using link:https://antora.org[Antora] to build the docs requires this standard so that
the static site generator (SSG) can locate the documentation components,
collect the content files, and then build the site.

Component::
A documentation component contains AsciiDoc files, their optional assets and
examples, one or more optional navigation files, and a component descriptor file
per repository.
All of the files in a component are versioned together.

--
While it is common to find all of a component's files in a single repository, a
component can be distributed across several repositories.
For instance, in the future, we may aggregate the Developer Guide component from
_developers_guide_ and _code_examples_ repositories.

A component isn't recognized by a repository or directory.
Instead, the presence of a file named `antora.yaml` indicates that the directories
and files nested under it are part of a component.
--

Component Descriptor::
A component must contain a component descriptor file named `antora.yaml`.
When Antora finds `antora.yaml` in a repository, it knows it has located a component or part of component.
The component descriptor tags the files under its hierarchy with the specified component name and version.

// LLP 10.08.21 Versioning is not currently used in Stargate
//Component-Version::
//In these contributing pages, issues, and the Antora documentation, the
//term _component-version_ is used when discussing concepts that apply to a version of a component.
//It's important to remember that a component's name and a component's version
//*may be very different* than the names of the repository and branch where it's stored.

Module::
A module is a discrete bundle of content, including text, images, and other
source materials, organized in a hierarchy of folders by content format, then
by optional topic if needed.
A module is stored in a component's _modules_ directory.
A component can contain one or more modules.

ROOT Module::
The ROOT module contains all the content that's directly associated with the
component itself.
When pages in the ROOT module are published, these pages are promoted a level
above any other modules' pages in that component's URL.

Pages::
The _pages_ directory contains a module's AsciiDoc files.
These files are automatically converted to standalone HTML pages.
See the xref:pages.adoc[Standard Document Structure] to learn how to structure an AsciiDoc file.

[[partials-dir]]Partials::
The _partials_ directory contains AsciiDoc files that aren't standalone pages.
These files are referenced by an xref:includes.adoc[include directive] from a
document in the _pages_ directory.

Assets::
Multimedia and supplemental files, organized by format, are stored in the _assets_ directory.
Photographs, screenshots, and graphic files in _assets/images_ are inserted into
pages using the xref:basics.adoc#images[image macro].

[[examples-dir]]Examples::
Non-AsciiDoc files, such as source code, are stored in the _examples_ directory.
These files are often inserted into xref:code-blocks.adoc[code blocks] using
an xref:includes.adoc[include directive].

Attachments::
The _attachments_ directory contains non-AsciiDoc files, such as PDF or HTML files.
This directory is processed by Antora in a non-configurable manner to include
non-AsciiDoc files. We currently use this directory to include HTML files for the
API references that are separately generated by `redoc-cli`.


Navigation::
A xref:update-nav.adoc[navigation file], often named _nav.adoc_, contains one
or more AsciiDoc lists.
Antora uses these files to build the site's xref:nav-menus-and-files.adoc[component navigation menus].
