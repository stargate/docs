== Go processing result set

After executing a query, a response returns rows that match the SELECT statement.
If there are no rows, the returned payload is unset.
The convenience function `ToResultSet()` is provided to help transform this
response into a result set that's easier to work with.

Since the result type is known, the `ToString` function transforms the value into a native string.
Additional functions also exist for other types such as `int`, `map`, and `blob`.
