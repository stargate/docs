== Go processing result set

After executing a query a response will be returned containing rows for a SELECT 
statement, otherwise the returned payload will be unset:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-toResultSet.go[]
----

Since the result type is known, the `ToString` function transforms the value into a native string.
Additional functions also exist for other types such as `int`, `map`, and `blob`.
