:page-tag: stargate,dev,develop

=== Getting started

Clone the repo, then install dependencies:

[source, shell]
----
go mod download
----

=== Testing

The tests for this project can be run from the root using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$go/go-run-test.go[]
----

The addition of `-tags integration` also runs the integration tests.

=== Generating gRPC code stubs

To update the protobuf files being used, add the new files to the top level proto
directory and then run `make proto` from the root of the project.
After running, you will find the new generated ``*.pb.go` files in `stargate/pkg/proto`.

=== Coding style

This project uses `golangci-lint` to lint code.
These standards are enforced automatically in the CI pipeline.
