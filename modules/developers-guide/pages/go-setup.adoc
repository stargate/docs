== Go set-up

To begin, you'll need to add the necessary dependency to your project

[source, shell]
----
go get -u github.com/stargate/stargate-grpc-go-client
----

If you don't already have access to a Stargate deployment one can be started quickly for testing.
Use the following Docker command to run Stargate locally in developer mode and expose port 8090 for gRPC connections:

[source, shell]
----
docker run --name stargate \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -d \
  -e CLUSTER_NAME=stargate \
  -e CLUSTER_VERSION=3.11 \
  -e DEVELOPER_MODE=true \
  stargateio/stargate-3_11:v1.0.35
----

Ensure the local instance of Stargate is running properly by tailing the logs for the container:

[source, shell]
----
docker logs -f stargate
----

When you see this message, Stargate is ready for traffic:

[source, plaintext]
----
Finished starting bundles.
