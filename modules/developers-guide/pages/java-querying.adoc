== Java querying
:page-tag: stargate,dev,develop

A simple query can be performed by passing a CQL query to the client using the
`ExecuteQuery()` function for standard query execution:

[source, java]
----
include::example$java/java-grpc-sync-query.java[]
----

Data definition (DDL) queries are supported in the same manner:

[source, java]
----
include::example$java/java-ddl-query.java[]
----

In general, users will create a keyspace and table first.

If you would like to use a

the client also provides an `ExecuteBatch()` function to execute a batch query:

[source, java]
----
include::example$java/java-grpc-batch-query.java[]
----
The `ExecuteQuery` function can be used to execute a single query.

This example inserts two values into the keyspace table `test.users`.
Only `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations can be used in a batch query.
