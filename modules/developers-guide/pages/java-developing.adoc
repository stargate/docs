== Java developing


=== Generating gRPC code stubs

To see a guide how the Java code is compiled from the proto files see the
link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/README.md#download[gRPC setup project dependencies].
To update the protobuf files being used, add the new files to the top level proto
directory and then run make proto from the root of the project.
