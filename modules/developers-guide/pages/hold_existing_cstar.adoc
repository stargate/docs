include::quickstart:partial$text/docker_run_existing_cstar.sh[]

The full set of options are described in xref:starctl.adoc[the `starctl` documentation].

CAUTION: When Stargate is launched within a container on Mac OS X as shown above,
it will connect only to Cassandra clusters running within the same Docker
environment. To run Stargate so that it can connect to a cluster running outside
of a containerized environment, see the xref:starctl.adoc[starctl] documentation.
