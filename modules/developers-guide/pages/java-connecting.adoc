== Java connecting

Once we have the generated code, we are ready to create the client based on that.
Before delving into the code, we need to generate the auth token that will be used to perform Authorization,
to see how to do it, please visit the xref:auth.adoc[Stargate Authz documentation].
For the development purpose, this should be good enough:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/java-connect-gen-auth.sh[]
----
assuming that Stargate is running on the `localhost:8081`

Once we have that, we can connect to the gRPC API.
First, generate the `Channel` that is used to perform connection:

[source, java]
----
include::example$java/java-grpc-create-channel.java[]
----

Please note that `usePlaintext()` is only for development and test.
When using `Channel` in a production environment, load balancer that terminates TLS should be used.

For local development of Stargate, the channel is:

[source, java]
----
include::example$java/java-grpc-create-localhost.java[]
