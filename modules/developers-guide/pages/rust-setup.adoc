== Rust set-up

.Add required dependencies.
You'll need at least stargate-grpc and an async framework, e.g. tokio:

[source, rust]
----
[devependencies]
stargate-grpc = { git = "https://github.com/stargate/stargate-grpc-rust-client" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"]}
----

Add the following line to the includes in the source code of your app:

[source, rust]
----
use stargate_grpc::*;
----
