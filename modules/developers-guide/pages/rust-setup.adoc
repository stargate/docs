* xref:creating-a-table-in-your-keyspace.adoc[Create a table in your keyspace]
* xref:start-stargate.adoc[Start Stargate (optional)]

=== Add dependencies

. Add required dependencies to the `cargo.toml` file in your Rust project.
You'll need at least stargate-grpc and an async framework, such as link:https://tokio.rs/[tokio]:

[source, rust]
----
include::example$rust/rust-setup-dependencies.rs[]
----
+
. Build the project with `cargo build` and fetch and compile the dependencies.
+
. Add the following line to the includes in the source code of your app, such as `main.rs`:
+
[source, rust]

include::example$rust/rust-setup-use.rs[]
