== Node.js querying

A simple query can be performed by passing a CQL query to the client using the
`ExecuteQuery()` function for standard query execution:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-simple-query.js[]
----

Data definition (DDL) queries are supported in the same manner:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-ddl-query.js[]
----

If you would like to use a
link:https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/cql/dml.html#batch_statement[batch statement],
the client also provides an `ExecuteBatch()` function to execute a batch query:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-batch.js[]
----

=== Promise support

The Node gRPC implementation uses callbacks by default.
If you'd prefer promises, this library provides a utility function to create a
promisified version of the Stargate gRPC client.
The promise will reject if an error occurs:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-query-promisify.js[]
----

The `metadata` and `callOptions` arguments are both optional.
