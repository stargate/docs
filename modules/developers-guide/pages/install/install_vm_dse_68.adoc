== Stargate on virtual machine or bare metal

Stargate can be installed alongside an existing DSE cluster using a virtual
machine or bare metal.

[Optional] Make sure DSE is up and running.
Stargate requires authentication, so be sure to enable it in the
https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cass_yaml_file.html#authenticator[cassandra.yaml] file.
If you don't have a cluster running, use these instructions to install
https://docs.datastax.com/en/install/6.8/install/installWhichOne.html[DSE 6.8].

Next, prepare a virtual machine to install Stargate on. You'll need to be sure
Java 8 is installed.

Once you have a machine ready,
download the https://github.com/stargate/stargate/releases/download/v1.0.7/stargate-jars.zip[Stargate zip file].
This file will provide the jar files that are required to run Stargate.
A typical method is using wget:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example$bash/wget_sg_jars_dse_68.sh[]
----

Unzip the files:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/unzip_sg_jars.sh[]
----

Make sure that `port 7000` is open on the Stargate machine. This port is the
default inter-node communication port that DSE and Stargate use to
pass communications.

Now start Stargate using the `starctl` command, the main command for starting
and configuring Stargate:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/start_vm_syntax.sh[]
----

For example:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/start_vm_68.sh[]
----

where

* `stargate_test_cluster` is the name of the DSE cluster
* `172.31.29.170` is the IP address of the DSE node
* `172.31.29.175` is the IP address of the Stargate node
(Stargate uses this IP address to broadcast itself, to join a DSE cluster as a coordinator node)  
* `DC1` is the name of the data center of the DSE node
* `RACK1` is the name of the data center of the DSE node
The full set of options are described in xref:starctl.adoc[the `starctl` documentation].

[TIP]
====
If you are unsure of the datacenter and rack, run `nodetool status` on the DSE node you are connected to. 
====

After a few seconds, you should see that Stargate has started.
You will see log output in your terminal display.   
If you get a binding error, then you may have tried to start Stargate incorrectly and the process is still running.
Terminate that process and start it again.
