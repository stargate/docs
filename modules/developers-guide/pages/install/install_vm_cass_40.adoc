== Stargate on virtual machine or bare metal

Stargate can be installed alongside an existing Cassandra cluster using a virtual
machine or bare metal.

[Optional] Make sure Cassandra is up and running.
Stargate requires authentication, so be sure to enable it in the
https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cass_yaml_file.html#authenticator[cassandra.yaml] file.
If you don't have a cluster running, use these instructions to install
https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/installing.html#choosing-an-installation-method[Cassandra 3.11].

Next, prepare a virtual machine to install Stargate on. You'll need to be sure
Java 8 is installed.

Once you have a machine ready,
download the https://github.com/stargate/stargate/releases/download/v1.0.7/stargate-jars.zip[Stargate zip file].
This file will provide the jar files that are required to run Stargate.
A typical method is using wget:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example$bash/wget_sg_jars_cass_40.sh[]
----

Unzip the files:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/unzip_sg_jars.sh[]
----

Make sure that `port 7000` is open on the Stargate machine. This port is the
default inter-node communication port that Cassandra and Stargate use to
pass communications.

Now start Stargate using the `starctl` command, the main command for starting
and configuring Stargate:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/start_vm_syntax.sh[]
----

For example:

[source, shell]
----
include::example$bash/start_vm_40.sh[]
----

where

* `stargate_test_cluster` is the name of the Cassandra cluster
* `172.31.29.170` is the IP address of the Cassandra node
* `172.31.29.175` is the IP address of the Stargate node
(Stargate uses this IP address to broadcast itself, to join a Cassandra cluster as a coordinator node)  
* `DC1` is the name of the data center of the Cassandra node
* `RACK1` is the name of the data center of the Cassandra node
The full set of options are described in xref:starctl.adoc[the `starctl` documentation].

[TIP]
====
If you are unsure of the datacenter and rack, run `nodetool status` on the Cassandra node you are connected to. 
====

After a few seconds, you should see that Stargate has started.
You will see log output in your terminal display.   
If you get a binding error, then you may have tried to start Stargate incorrectly and the process is still running.
Terminate that process and start it again.

That's it! You are ready to try a Stargate xref:quickstart:quickstart.adoc[QuickStart].
