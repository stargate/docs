There are several ways that Stargate can be used with Apache Cassandra.

* If you are a developer who just needs a simple platform to test out ideas,
starting Stargate as a xref:standalone_docker_40[standalone container with Docker] is a good choice.
* If you already have Cassandra running in a xref:docker_compose_40[docker-compose application], or want
to start Stargate with multiple nodes of Cassandra, installing with `docker-compose`
is a simple method.
* If you need to install Stargate with a running Cassandra cluster in either
xref:vm_40[virtual machines or bare metal], use the method that downloads a zip file of
Stargate jar files and install.

Once you have installed Stargate, you are ready to try one of the  Stargate xref:quickstart:quickstart.adoc[QuickStarts].
