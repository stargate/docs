= DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 6.8

include::developers-guide:partial$astra_tip.adoc[]

There are several ways that Stargate can be used with DataStax Enterprise.

* If you are a developer who just needs a simple platform to test out ideas,
starting Stargate as a xref:standalone_docker_dse_68[standalone container with Docker] is a good choice.
* If you already have DSE running in a xref:docker_compose_dse_68[docker-compose application], or want
to start Stargate with multiple nodes of DSE, installing with `docker-compose`
is a simple method.
* If you need to install Stargate with a running DSE cluster in either
xref:vm_dse_68[virtual machines or bare metal], use the method that downloads a zip file of
Stargate jar files and install.

Once you have installed Stargate, you are ready to try one of the  Stargate xref:quickstart:quickstart.adoc[QuickStarts].
