= Using metrics with Stargate

Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a database.
Metrics can be monitored using Prometheus and Grafana. A
https://github.com/stargate/docker-images/[`docker-compose`
script] is available to run Apache Cassandra^(TM)^, Stargate, Prometheus, and Grafana
together to explore the metrics available.

// end::getDockerImage[]

== Access Prometheus
Once all the images are running, you can access https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] in the browser at
http://localhost:9090/[http://localhost:9090].

Note that the default file `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` is replaced with a
mounted file from the docker-compose repository, to identify the stargate node
as the target for gathering metrics.
The default target of `localhost:9090` (the Prometheus node) has been replaced with
'stargate:8085' (the stargate node's metrics port).

The Stargate metrics are grouped by API, and can accessed as any other metrics are
accessed in http://prometheus.io[Prometheus].

== Access Grafana
Once all the images are running, you can access http://grafana.com/oss/grafana[Grafana] in the browser at
http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000].
You'll need to login with the default username and password, `admin/admin`.
Grafana will require you to create a new password to proceed.

Add Prometheus as a data source by clicking the data source icon on the lefthand side
editing the form with the following information:

* Edit the HTTP URL field to add `http://localhost:9090`
* Change the HTTP Access field to `Browser`.

Press "Save & Test" to check that the data source is added.
Add a new dashboard and choose Prometheus as the data source.
The Stargate metrics can be selected as a metric to display.
