== Rust connecting

=== Authentication

This example assumes that you're running Stargate locally with the default credentials
of `cassandra/cassandra`.
For more information regarding authentication please see the
link:https://stargate.io/docs/stargate/1.0/developers-guide/authnz.html[Stargate authentication and authorization docs].

Insert the generated token with the following code snippet in the client code:

[source, rust]
----
include::example$rust/rust-auth.rs[]
----

=== Set up client

The main structure that provides the interface to Stargate is `StargateClient`.
Pass the connection channel and the Stargate authentication token to
`StargateClient::with_auth` to obtain an instance of the client:

[source, rust]
----
include::example$rust/rust-connecting-withAuth.rs[]
----
