= The starctl command

The `starctl` command controls and configures Stargate nodes.

== Starting Stargate using starctl

[source,bash]
----
starctl --cluster-name stargate \
  --cluster-seed 127.0.0.1 \
  --cluster-version 3.11 \
  --listen 127.0.0.2 \

.starctl options
|===
| Option | Parameter | Default | Description | Example

| `--cluster-name`
| `_cluster name_`
|
| Name of the database cluster to connect to.
| `stargate`

| `--cluster-seed`
| `_IP address_`
|
| The IP address of a seed node in the database cluster. The value must be a valid IP address.
| `192.168.0.1`


| `--cluster-version`
| `_Cassandra version_`
|
| The major version of the database cluster.
| `3.11`

| `--listen`
| `_IP address_`
| 127.0.0.1
| IP address Stargate services should listen on. The value must be a valid IP address.
| `192.168.0.1`

| `--seed-port`
| `_port number_`
| 7000
| Port number that seed nodes are listening on. The value of this option must fall in one of the following port ranges: 0, 1024-49151, 49152-65535
| `7001`

| `--dc`
| `_datacenter name_`
|
| Datacenter name of this node. This value must be one of the datacenters defined in the database cluster.
| `dc1`

| `--rack`
| `_rack name_`
|
| Rack name of this node. This value must be one of the racks defined in the database cluster.
| `rack1`

| `--simple-snitch`
|
|
| Set this option if the database cluster uses `SimpleSnitch` as the `endpoint_snitch`. Use this option if the link:https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11/conf/cassandra.yaml#L962[endpoint_snitch] setting in the cluster is set to *SimpleSnitch*. If the cluster uses a different `endpoint_snitch` use the `--dc` and `--rack` options to define the topology of the node.
|

| `--dse`
|
|
| Set this option if the database cluster is DSE. Do not set this option if the database cluster is Cassandra.
|

| `--cql-port`
| `_port number_`
| 9042
| Port number on which the CQL API service listens. The value of this option must fall in one of the following port ranges: 0, 1024-49151, 49152-65535
| `9043`

| `--enable-auth`
|
|
| Set this option to enable `PasswordAuthenticator` in the cluster.
|

| `--use-proxy-protocol`
|
|
| Set this option to use proxy protocol to determine the public address and port of CQL requests.
|

| `--developer-mode`
|
|
| Enables developer mode. In this mode the Stargate node behaves as a regular Cassandra node. It will join the ring with tokens assigned in order to facilitate getting started quickly. This is useful as no additional nodes or existing cluster are required. This mode is unsuitable for production use.
|

|`--bind-to-listen-address`
|
|
| Set this option to bind the web services to the listen address only.
