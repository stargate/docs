.starctl options
|===
| Option | Parameter | Default | Description | Example

| `--cluster-name`
| `_cluster name_`
|
| Name of database cluster.
| `stargate`

| `--cluster-seed`
| `_seed node IP address_`
|
| The IP address of the seed node of the cluster.
| `192.168.0.1`


| `--cluster-version`
| `_Cassandra version_`
|
| The major version of the database cluster.
| `3.11`

| `--listen`
| `_listen IP address_`
| 127.0.0.1
| IP address Stargate services should listen on. This options value must match the regular expression
`^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`. Must be a valid IP address.
| `192.168.0.1`

| `--seed-port`
| `_port number_`
| 7000
| Port that seed nodes are listening on. This options value represents a port and must fall in one of the following port ranges: 0, 1024-49151, 49152-65535
| `7001`

| `--dc`
| `_datacenter name_`
|
| Datacenter name of this node. This must match the database backend.
| `dc1`

| `--rack`
| `_rack name_`
|
| Rack name of this node. This must match the database backend.
| `rack1`

| `--simple-snitch`
|
|
| Set this option if the backend cluster uses `SimpleSnitch` as the `endpoint_snitch`.
|

| `--dse`
|
|
| Set if the backend is DSE. Do not set this option if the backend is Cassandra.
|

| `--cql-port`
| `_port number_`
| 9042
| Port on which the CQL API service listens. This options value represents a port and must fall in one of the following port ranges: 0, 1024-49151, 49152-65535

| Enables developer mode, where the Stargate node behaves as a regular Cassandra node, joining the ring with tokens assigned in order to facilitate getting started quickly and not requiring additional nodes or an existing cluster.
|

|`--bind-to-listen-address`
|
|
| If set bind the web services to the listen address only.

WARNING: When Stargate is launched on a host as shown above, it will connect only to Cassandra clusters accessible on the host's network. To run Stargate in a containerized environment, see the link:existing_cstar[Installing Stargate with an existing Cassandra cluster] documentation.
