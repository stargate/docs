== Go querying

A simple query can be performed by passing a CQL query to the client using the
`ExecuteQuery()` function for standard query execution:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-simple-query.go[]
----

Data definition (DDL) queries are supported in the same manner:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-ddl-query.go[]
----

Parameterized queries are also supported:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-parameterized.go[]
----

If you would like to use a

the client also provides an `ExecuteBatch()` function to execute a batch query:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-batch.go[]
----
