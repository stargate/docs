== Rust processing result set

The result set comes back as a collection of rows.
A row can be easily unpacked into a tuple:

[source, rust]
----
include::example$rust/rust-processing1-tuple.rs[]
----

It is also possible to read each field separately and convert it to desired type, without dropping the original row:

[source, rust]
----
include::example$rust/rust-processing2-type.rs[]
----
