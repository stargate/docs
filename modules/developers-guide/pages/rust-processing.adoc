== Rust processing result set

The result set comes back as a collection of rows.
A row can be easily unpacked into a tuple:

[source, rust]
----
for row in result_set.rows {
    let (login, emails): (String, Vec<String>) = row.try_into()?;
    // ...
}
----

It is also possible to read each field separately and convert it to desired type, without dropping the original row:

[source, rust]
----
for row in result_set.rows {
    let login: String = row.get(0)?;
    let emails: Vec<String> = row.get(1)?;
    // ...
}
----
