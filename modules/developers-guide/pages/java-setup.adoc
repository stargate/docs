== gRPC Java client setup

=== Prerequisites

* xref:authnz.adoc[Get an application token]
* * Create a table in your keyspace: xref:rest-using.adoc#_create_a_keyspace[(REST)]  xref:graphql-first-using.adoc#_create_a_keyspace[(GraphQL)]
* xref:start-stargate.adoc[Start Stargate (optional)]

=== Add dependencies

To begin, add the required dependency to your project:

[source, xml]
----
include::example$xml/java-setup.xml[]
----

If you do not add it, you will observe the following error:

[source, shell]
----
No functional channel service provider found.
Try adding a dependency on the grpc-okhttp, grpc-netty, or grpc-netty-shaded artifact.
----

Once we have all needed dependencies, we can use the Stargate gRPC-stub API.
After this step, you should have `StargateGrpc` available on your class path
(from the `grpc-proto` dependency).
It contains the logic for interacting with Stargate gRPC API.
