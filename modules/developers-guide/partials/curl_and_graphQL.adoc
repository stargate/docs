[TIP]
====
Working with graphQL, there are three ways to enter queries:

. In the GraphQL playground, copy and paste the following to a tab pointing to
localhost:8080/graphql-schema:

[source, plaintext]
----
include::example$graphql/createKeyspace.graphql[]
----

[arabic, start=2]
. If you wish to submit the mutation using a curl command, use a JSON file as
the data:

[source, plaintext]
----
include::example$graphql/1curl_createKeyspaceWithFile.sh[]
----

where `createKeyspace.json`:

[source, plaintext]
----
include::example$graphql/createKeyspace.json[]
----

Compare `createKeyspace.json` to the source that you can copy/paste into the
playground, and notice the JSON decoration that is added.

[arabic, start=3]
. If you wish to submit the mutation using a curl command, not using a JSON file,
but directly adding the data, note that the JSON must be entered as a single line
of data.
