= Developing with the {database} GraphQL API (Schema-first)
:keywords: database, GraphQL, api

include::partial$stargate-intro-intro.adoc[]

The GraphQL API modifies and queries your table data using GraphQL object types, queries, and mutations.

== API reference

// LLP: 03.16.22 Need to create a schema-first Quickstart
//If you prefer to learn using a QuickStart, try out the xref:quickstart:quick_start-graphql.adoc[Stargate GraphQL CQL-first QuickStart, window="_blank"].

== About the GraphQL API endpoints

There are three {database} GraphQL API endpoints, one for creating schema in schema-first, one for deploying schema in the graphql-first, and the third for querying or mutating a keyspace. 
The URLS are:

Schema::
`{base_graphql_url}{base_gql_schema}`

Admin::
`{base_graphql_url}{base_gql_admin}`

Querying::
`{base_graphql_url}{base_gql_api}/{keyspace_name}`

The schema endpoint is used to create or alter CQL schema in the schema-first GraphQL using direct schema manipulation. 
The admin endpoint is used to deploy GraphQL schema in the graphql-first GraphQL which will indirectly modify underlying CQL schema. 
The querying endpoint is constructed in the same manner for both graphql-first and schema-first.

Each request must have a valid xref:core:manage:org/managing-org.adoc#managing-application-tokens[application token].
Each request can also have an optional unique request id.
The request id is recommended in a production environment and can be useful in troubleshooting issues.

[TIP]
====
**Generating UUIDs**
Consider using a tool like this https://www.uuidgenerator.net/[online UUID generator, window="_blank"]
to quickly create a random UUID to pass with your requests if you are submitting
the queries manually using a tool like cURL.
