// tag::UpdateData[]
=== Update data

A mutation can be turned into a update operation by starting the mutation
name with `update`.
A mutation will also be an update operation if it is annotated with `@cql_update`.
The mutation must take a single argument that is an input type for a mapped entity.
If successful, the mutation will return a Boolean value.
In order to execute the mutation, all primary key fields and at least one non-primary key
field must be input.

For example, the following mutation and associated query will update a single row:
