=== Create a user-defined type (UDT)

User-defined types (UDTs) can be created as GraphQL object types.
UDTs are optional, but if you wish to use a UDT in another object type definition,
you'll want to create the UDT first.
Once created, you can include the type in the schema deployed via the GraphQL playground.
Here are two examples that create a UDT called `Address` that includes a street, city, state, and zipcode,
and a UDT called `Review` that includes a book title, comment, rating and review data.

in the underlying database table.
