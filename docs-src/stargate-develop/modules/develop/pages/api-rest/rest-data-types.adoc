==== Data types
Many common data types are supported by the REST API, such as collections (set, list, map),
tuples, and user-defined types (UDTs).
In addition, collections can be specified as `frozen` collections.
Columns can be set to these data types in the original table creation,
or be added later.
Look in the next section for some examples of adding columns.
