=== A note about what schema is

A full GraphQL table schema can include user-defined types (UDTs) and indexes.
Queries and mutations are automatically generated based on the schema.
The next sections describes the definition of these items.

// tag::DataTypes[]
=== Data types

A column's CQL data type is inferred from the GraphQL table column type.
GraphQL's built-in scalar types are mapped:

[options="header",footer"]
|====
| GraphQL | CQL
| ID      | uuid
| String  | varchar
| Int     | int
| Float   | double
| Boolean | boolean
|====

In addition, Stargate provides a set of custom scalar types that map directly
to the CQL types of the same name:
Uuid, TimeUuid, Inet, Date, Duration, BigInt, Counter, Ascii, Decimal, Varint,
Float32, Blob, SmallInt, TinyInt, Timestamp, Time, Set, List, Map, Tuple.

Lastly, xref:api-graphql-cql-first/gql-creating-udt.adoc[user-defined types (UDTs)]
are supported.
