== Node.js querying
:page-tag: stargate,dev,develop

A simple query can be performed by passing a CQL query to the client using the
`executeQuery()` function for standard query execution:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-simple-query.js[]
----

Data definition (DDL) queries are supported in the same manner:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-ddl-query.js[]
----

Parameterized queries are also supported:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-parameterized.js[]
----

If you would like to use a
link:https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/cql/dml.html#batch_statement[batch statement],
the client also provides an `executeBatch()` function to execute a batch query:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-batch.js[]
----

=== Promise support

The Node gRPC implementation uses callbacks by default.
If you'd prefer promises, this https://github.com/stargate/stargate-grpc-node-client/tree/main/src/util[library] provides 
a utility function to create a promisified version of the Stargate gRPC client.
The promise will reject if an error occurs:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript/node-query-promisify.js[]
----

The `metadata` and `callOptions` arguments are both optional.
