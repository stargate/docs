== Go querying

A simple query can be performed by passing a CQL query to the client using the
`ExecuteQuery()` function for standard query execution:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-simple-query.go[]
----

Data definition (DDL) queries are supported in the same manner:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-ddl-query.go[]
----

In general, users will create a keyspace and table first.

Parameterized queries are also supported:

[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-parameterized.go[]
----

The `ExecuteQuery` function can be used to execute a single query.

If you need to group several commands together as a

the client also provides an `ExecuteBatch()` function to execute a batch query:


[source, go]
----
include::example$go/go-batch.go[]
----

This example inserts two values into the keyspace table `test.users`.
Only `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations can be used in a batch query.
