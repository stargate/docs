To compare the two approaches, let's look at an example that creates
a container (table or type) to hold information about  a `reader`:

[cols="l"]
|===
| cql-first
| reader: createTable(
  keyspaceName:"library",
  tableName:"reader",
  partitionKeys: [ { name: "name", type: {basic: TEXT} } ]
  # Secondary key used to access values within the partition
  clusteringKeys: [ { name: "user_id", type: {basic: UUID}, order: "ASC" } ]
  values: [
    { name: "birthdate", type: {basic: DATE} }
    { name: "email", type: {basic: SET, info:{ subTypes: [ { basic: TEXT } ] } } }
    { name: "reviews", type: {basic: TUPLE,
      info: { subTypes: [ { basic: TEXT }, { basic: INT }, { basic: DATE } ] } } }
    { name: "addresses", type: { basic: LIST,
      info: { subTypes: [ { basic: UDT, info: { name: "address_type", frozen: true } } ] } } }
    ]
  )
}
| schema-first
| type Reader @key @cql_entity(name: "reader") @cql_input {
  name: String! @cql_column(partitionKey: true)
  user_id: Uuid! @cql_column(clusteringOrder: ASC)
  birthdate: Date @cql_index(name: "date_idx")
  email: [String] @cql_column(typeHint: "set<varchar>")
  reviews: [Review] @cql_index(name: "review_idx", target: VALUES)
  address: [Address]
}
|===

The two approaches are similar, in that both must name the columns (cql-first) or
fields (schema-first). The data type must be specified for each column or field.
Although the syntax of the data type is different, by comparing, you can see
that they are similar. Each approach can define the primary key composed of one or
more partition keys and zero or more clustering keys.
The column `reviews` in the cql-first example is defined as a tuple, but since
the schema-first approach doesn't support tuples, a user-defined type `Review`
is used instead.
The UDTs are not included here for brevity, but are explained later.

The main difference in the two approaches shown here are the CQL directives included
in the schema-first type. To extend the power of Cassandra, these directives
allow a user to fine-tune, if you choose, how the type is defined in the underlying
database.

The other difference, not illustrated here, is that, in the cql-first approach,
mutations and queries are automatically generated, but no customization is possible.
In the schema-first approach, the developer is responsible for declaring the mutations
and queries, and so has the freedom to do whatever is needed for an application.
