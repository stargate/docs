There are several ways that Stargate can be used with DataStax Enterprise.

* If you are a developer who just needs a simple platform to test out ideas, you can:
** For v1, start Stargate as a xref:#standalone_docker_dse_68.adoc[developer mode with Docker].
** For v2, start Stargate with `docker-compose` in xref:#standalone_docker_dse_68.adoc[developer mode with Docker], that will start a Stargate coordinator that runs Cassandra, gRPC and CQL, plus the three APIs, each in its own container.
* If you already have Cassandra running in a xref:#docker_compose_dse_68[docker-compose application], or want to start Stargate with multiple nodes of Cassandra, installing with `docker-compose`
is a simple method.
* If you need to install Stargate with a running Cassandra cluster in either
xref:#vm_dse_68.adoc[virtual machines or bare metal], use the method that downloads a zip file of
Stargate jar files and install.

[CAUTION]
====
At this time Stargate does not support advanced workloads such as Graph and Search. 
If you are using any sort of search index in the keyspace you plan to use with Stargate they will need to be removed before Stargate deployment.

Once you have installed Stargate, you are ready to try one of the  Stargate xref:quickstart:quickstart-overview.adoc[QuickStarts].
