=== Generate an auth token

First generate an auth token that is required in each subsequent request
in the `X-Cassandra-Token` header. Note the port for the auth service is 8081.

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example$bash/get-table-based-token.sh[]
----

You should receive a token in the response.

[source,json]
----
{"authToken":"{auth-token}"}
