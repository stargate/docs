= Stargate documentation

This repo contains the source files for the Stargate documentation.

The docs are written in asciidoc and use Antora to generate the output.

The Stargate docs are organized into three Antora modules:

* The ROOT module, with general project infomation.
* A quickstart module, with basic documentation to get new users started.
* The developers-guide module with more extensive topics on all the features of Stargate.

== Dependencies

Antora requires NodeJS, install it and then install the project dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

== Viewing the current HTML output

The current development version of the docs are generated and published at https://stargate.github.io/docs/.

The `.github/workflows/antora.yml` GitHub action will generate and publish the development docs on pushes to the master branch. Development docs use the `site-local.yaml` Antora site configuration file.

== Generating and viewing the HTML output locally

The docs can be generated locally during development, to check work. 
To generate only the docs (faster if you don't need to check the OpenAPI docs):

[source,bash]
----
npm run build:local
----

To generate the docs and OpenAPI docs:

[source,bash]
----
npm run build:dev
----

Open `build/site/index.html` a web browser to view the output.

== Publishing to the Stargate website

Pushing a tag starting with `v` will trigger the `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` action that generates the docs and publishes them to the `stargate/website` repo in the `gh-pages` branch. The output will be put in the `docs` directory. Live docs use the `site-publish.yaml` Anotra site configuration file.

The Deploy to GitHub Pages action uses a repo secret in order to push the changes to stargate/website.
To use a different secret:

. https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets[Add it to stargate/docs as a repo secret].
. Update the name of the secret in `publish.yaml`.
